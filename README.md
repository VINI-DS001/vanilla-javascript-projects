# Vanilla Javascript projects
Repository to store initial Front-end projects made with Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS, some of which I intend to rebuild using React to improve my skills.

## Deploy

To deploy the applications I've used the 'Live Server' extension, available in VSCode. If you wish to install it, type:

```bash
  ctrl+P
```

and run the command:

```bash
  ext install ritwickdey.liveserver
```

To run it, right-click the html file and select ```Open with Live Server```, or press the ```Go Live``` button in the status bar in the lower right corner.
